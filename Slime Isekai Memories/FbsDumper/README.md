# FbsDumper
A tool to recover flatbuffers definitions from game assemblies.
It's exactly the same as [my old FBS dumper](https://github.com/Hiro420/FbsDumper), except it relies on asm instructions parsing.

- TODO: default values

## Originally made for Blue Archive, should theoretically work with other games but is untested.

# Usage 
- Specify the target variables in MainApp (currently hardcoded as I'm too lazy to de-hardcode)
- Build via Visual Studio 2022 or the command
```bash
dotnet build
```
- Run the tool (FbsDumper.exe)
